1.  Identify one problem in the below code block, will this code compile? Discuss the related Rust feature regarding the problem you have identified, why does Rust choose to include this feature? A few sentences are good enough.

    ```rust
        let data = vec![1, 2, 3];
        let my_ref_cell = RefCell::new(69);
        let ref_to_ref_cell = &my_ref_cell;

        std::thread::spawn(move || {

            println!("captured {data:?} by value");

            println!("Whats in the cell?? {ref_to_ref_cell:?}")

        }).join().unwrap();
    ```

3.  In `student.psv` there are some fake student datas from UNSW CSE (no doxx!). In each row, the fields from left to right are

    - UNSW Course Code
    - UNSW Student Number
    - Name
    - UNSW Program
    - UNSW Plan
    - WAM
    - UNSW Session
    - Birthdate
    - Sex

    Write a Rust program to find the course which has the highest average student WAM. **Write your program in the cargo project q3**.
