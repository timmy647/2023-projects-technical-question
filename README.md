# 2023 Projects Recruitment Technical Questions

Welcome, and thank you for applying to one of CSESoc Development's flagship projects!
This repository contains all questions for our technical screening.

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO ATTEMPT ALL QUESTIONS!**

There are two baseline questions, one for **frontend** and one for **backend**. Some projects
may also have their own questions, because their tech stack requires specific knowledge
(e.g. the backend for Chaos is written in Rust).

**We do not expect applicants to do all questions.** Please choose questions that you
feel would best reflect the projects you want to join (i.e. if you want to work on
frontend, do the frontend question). At the top of each technical question, there
will be a section that details which projects the question is relevant for.

## Submitting

To submit your solution, make a fork of the this repository and fill in your answers
for each question according the the `README.md` of that question. There should be a
place for you to upload your answers on the Projects subcom application - put the link
to your forked repository there.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
